The sPool integration testing suite:

- Programs present in the testing suite:
  Our testing suite follows the format of the testing suite we submitted for 
  our scanner and parser deliverable: there are directories under tests/codegen
  that contain a bunch of tests. Tests that are expected to succeed are 
  named with test-<testname[n]>.sP with their corresponding gold-standard output 
  stored in test-<testname[n]>.out, whereas tests that are expected to fail 
  are named with fail-<testname[n]>.sP with their corresponding gold-standard 
  error output stored in fail-<testname[n]>.err. The description of the 
  programs present in our testing suite is given below:

       - test-if1 : Testing that if the condition for if is true, then the program  
                    goes into the if block and executes that section. The conditional
                    is an equality check between two integers.
       - test-if2 : Testing that if the condition for if is false, then the program
                    goes into the else block and executes that section.

       - fail-list1 : Testing that a creation of heterogeneous list fails
       - fail-list2 : Testing that the List_insert built-in function fails by inserting
                      a type different from that of elements in the supplied list literal
       - test-list1 :  Testing the List_insert built-in function with inserting elements
                       to the front, middle and back of a list.
       - test-list2 :  Testing the List_insert built-in function with inserting elements
                       to an empty list.
       - test-list3 :  Testing the polymorphic feature of list via spawning 
                       lists of integers, strings, booleans, float, threads 
                       as well as a list of lists of integers.

                       an element at the front, in the middle and at the back.
       - test-list5 :  Testing the List_remove built-in function with removing
                       an element at the front, in the middle and at the back.
       - test-list6 :  Testing the List_at built-in function with accessing
                       an element at the front, in the middle and at the back.
       - test-list7 :  Testing the List_len built-in function with printing out
                       the length of a list before and after removing and inserting 
                       elements from/to it.
       - test-list8 :  Testing lists to be passed and stored as references. Multiple list 
                       variables point to the same list, changes are being made to the list 
                       by calling list-modifying functions with different list variables, 
                       while the change is preserved when the same list is accessed via all 
                       three list variables.

       - fail-print1 : Testing a semantic error related to the print built-in function 
                       by supplying a non-string integer argument to it.

                       string value.

       - fail-strings1 : Testing that the String_substr built-in function fails on an
                         argument with the incorrect type.
       - test-strings1 : Testing the String_substr built-in function by printing

       - test-thread1 : Testing waiting for an asynchronous thread to finish 
                        executing works as expected. The main thread only 
                        exits after the expected outputs have been printed 
                        to stdout.
       - test-thread2 : Similar to test-thread1, but now there are ten threads 
                        concurrently printing to stdout. This test waits for 
                        all threads to be done before the main thread exits, 
                        ensuring that the output is always deterministic.

Scripts provided:

NOTE: For all scripts mentioned below, please ensure that you are within the `src` 
directory.

- Compile the compiler:
       A Makefile is provided which compiles the compiler into an executable. 
       When present in the `src` directory, type `make` to generate the executable 
       file named `toplevel.native`. To successfully compile the sPool compiler, it 
       is expected that the tools required to compile the MicroC compiler are 
       present on the host machine, i.e., basic OCaml toolchain (ocaml, ocamlbuild, 
       ocamllex, ocamlyacc, ocamlfind, opam) as well as LLVM (LLVM on the host 
       machine and the Ocaml LLVM API installed using opam) must be present. 
       Other than these tools and Python3 (tested on versions 3.8.10 and higher, 
       although lower versions should still work), no additional packages/tools 
       are needed to compile the sPool compiler or to run any of the 
       included tests.

- Run all tests:
       To run all tests in this integration testing suite, type:
       
              `make testcodegen`

       This should automatically compile the compiler and run our `runtests.py` python script
       to run all tests in the testsuite.

- Run all tests in a specific directory:
        To run all tests in a testname directory type:

            `python3 runtests.py <TESTPHASE> all <TESTDIR>` 
        
        where <TESTPHASE> is the name of the directory in sPool/tests/
        and <TESTDIR> is the name of the directory in sPool/tests/<TESTPHASE>/


- Run a single test:

       To run a single test, type:
              `python3 runtests.py codegen <TESTDIR> <TESTNAME>` 
              
       where <TESTDIR> is the name of the directory in sPool/tests/codegen/ and <TESTNAME> is the 
       name of the test without the extension `.sP` in sPool/test/codegen/<TESTDIR>/
       
       For example, if you want to run an individual test on the test-list8.sP file under 
       sPool/tests/codegen/list, type:
              `python3 runtests.py codegen list test-list8`
       
       Similarly, if you want to run the test on the fail-strings1.sP file 
       under sPool/tests/codegen/strings, type:
              `python3 runtests.py codegen strings fail-strings1`

- Run the compiler on a given source file:

       To compile a specific sPool source file, type
              `./compile.sh [-stdlib] <file> <executable>`
       
       where <file> is the sPool src file to be compiled, and the <executable>
       is the name of the executable generated. [-stdlib] is an optional flag
       which, if included, will include all standard library functions in 
       compilation for use by the program. The intermediate files generated 
       in the process will be present in the same directory from which the 
       compile script was run. There are two files generated for each sPool 
       source file compiled -- the LLVM IR (having .ll extension) and the 
       assembly file (having .s extension).

       For instance, if you want to compile a sPool source file hello.sP, run:
              `./compile.sh hello.sP a.out`
       The resulting executable will be named a.out, so running `./a.out` will 
       execute the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How testing works:

- Successful compilation and output validation:
       If the compilation was successful, then it would exhibit no errors. 
       The compilation step involves three stages: compiling the sPool source 
       file to LLVM IR, compiling the LLVM IR to assembly, and then linking 
       this assembly file with the external object file written in C to produce
       the final executable. The testing script does all this to produce an 
       executable for every test that is expected to pass. If there were any 
       errors in any of these steps, the process of testing is stopped and the 
       error is reported. Otherwise, the executable is run for each test whose
       output is compared with what we expect (aka the "gold standard", present 
       in the .out files). If they are equivalent the test passes with the 
       message `Test <test.sP> PASSED`, where `test.sP` is the test file. 
       Any errors would show the expected output and the output we got on the 
       test report screen.

- Unsuccessful compilation:
       If the compilation was unsuccessful, it could be due to a semantic error, 
       a lexing error, or a parsing error. In this case, an error will be raised
       terminating compilation. Our compilation error strategy is to halt 
       compilation at the time of the first error and display the error message
       to the user.

       The testing script will, for tests that are expected to fail, compare 
       the expected error message against the one we received while trying 
       to compile the program and determine if the compilation process 
       was successful or not.
