# README

Basic syntax highlighting and snippets for sPool, a statically 
typed general purpose programming language. This language was 
developed for CS107 (Compilers) at Tufts University.

# Supported Features

Currently, snippets for `if`, `while`, `def`, and `lambda` are supported
with several variations (like `def` with and without `store`, `if` with
and without `else`, etc.). These should be sufficient to write a 
program effortlessly in sPool, your new favorite programming language!
